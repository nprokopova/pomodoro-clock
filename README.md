2.  **Description.**

    This was a FreeCodeCamp project to obtain the Front End Development libraries certificate. 

    This is a basic Pomodoro clock where Session and Break length can be set by the user. Once a Session ends, a new Break starts and the two alternate until the Clock is Reset or Paused. An alarm sounds at the end of each Session and Break. 

    The project requirements can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock
