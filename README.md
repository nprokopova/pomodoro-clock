##  **Description**

This project was initially created on codepen.io for the FCC Front End Development libraries certification course (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock). The code was then migrated to a Gatsby.js framework and refactored.

This is a Pomodoro (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) clock where the Session and Break length can be set by the user. Once a Session ends, a new Break starts and the two alternate until the Clock is Reset or Paused. An alarm sounds at the end of each Session and Break.
